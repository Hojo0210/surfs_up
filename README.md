# surfs_up

## Overview
An analysis was performed using the "hawaii.sqlite" file to determine the temperature data for the months of June and December. Additional queries were performed to determine the precipitation data for those months. This data was useful to gain insight on wether or not the ice cream and surf shop would be viable year-round. 

## Results
- The average temperature for June is just under 75 degrees, the minimum is 64 degrees and the max is 85 degrees. 75% of our data is under 77 degrees, this would be perfect weather for outdoor activites.  
- The average temperature for December is 71 degrees, with a minimum of 56 and a maximum of 83. The data for December is not terribly far from June, and is still fairly mild.

- Both June and December don't report much rainfall, with and average of ~0.14 and ~0.22 inches respectively. 50% of our data is under 0.03 inches, which leads me to believe that it is fairly agreeable weather during those months
