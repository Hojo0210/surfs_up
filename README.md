# surfs_up

## Overview
An analysis was performed using the "hawaii.sqlite" file to determine the temperature data for the months of June and December. Additional queries were performed to determine the precipitation data for those months. This data was useful to gain insight on wether or not the ice cream and surf shop would be viable year-round. 

## Results
- The average temperature for June is just under 75 degrees, the minimum is 64 degrees and the max is 85 degrees. 75% of our data is under 77 degrees, this would be perfect weather for outdoor activites.  
- The average temperature for December is 71 degrees, with a minimum of 56 and a maximum of 83. The data for December is not terribly far from June, and is still fairly mild. 
-  It would appear that both businesses would do alright in these climates. The mimimum temp for December might keep people from getting ice cream, but that would be very infrequent.

- Both June and December don't report much rainfall, with and average of ~0.14 and ~0.22 inches respectively. 50% of our data is under 0.03 inches, which leads me to believe that it is fairly agreeable weather during those months

## Summary
Based on the information gathered, both businesses seem like they would perform well in this location year round. A good portion of our data is in a very favorable temerature range, and there is likely going to be very little rain. Some of the cooler days may keep patron from buying ice cream. That being said, the coldest part of the day is usually late at night, there is a good chance that the daytime temperatures during the "colder" days would still bring people to the ice cream shop. As far as the surf shop is concerned, It appears that the weather is good enough to keep poeple surfing year round, therfore there should be a decent demand for the good sold in the  surf shop.
